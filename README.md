# AutoAI-Model-Bulding-In-IBM-Watson-Studio

Loan-default-prediction-autoAI-model
Predicts if a loan applicant is likely to default using income, credit history, and loan details for risk analysis.

üè¶ Loan Default Prediction using IBM Watson AutoAI
Built an ML model using IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI to predict whether a loan applicant will default. AutoAI automates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. This project demonstrates how fast and efficient automated machine learning (AutoML) can be for solving real-world classification problems.

üìå About the Project
This machine learning project leverages IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI to build a predictive model for loan default risk based on applicant information. With minimal manual coding, AutoAI handles:

Data cleaning and transformation
Feature engineering
Model training and selection
Hyperparameter tuning
The project shows how AutoAI can accelerate ML development and provide strong baseline models for credit risk prediction.

‚öôÔ∏è AutoAI Workflow
Upload the Loan Default Dataset (train.csv) to your IBM Watson Studio project.
Create a new AutoAI experiment and attach the dataset.
Select target column: Loan_Status
AutoAI performs:
Automated data cleaning and preprocessing
Feature transformation and encoding
Model generation using algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.
Hyperparameter optimization
Leaderboard evaluation for model comparison
The best model is chosen based on accuracy, F1-score, and other metrics.
Export or deploy the model for API-based predictions.
üìà Results
Target Column: Loan_Status
Best Performing Model: XGBoostClassifier (may vary based on dataset)
Accuracy Achieved: ~82‚Äì85% (varies with data quality)
Key Predictors Identified by AutoAI:
Credit_History
ApplicantIncome
LoanAmount
Property_Area
Education
AutoAI also provides model explainability and a leaderboard of all trained models for comparison.
