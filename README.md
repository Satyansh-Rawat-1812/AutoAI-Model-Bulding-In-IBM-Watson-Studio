# Loan-default-prediction-autoAI-model
Predicts if a loan applicant is likely to default using income, credit history, and loan details for risk analysis.

# üè¶ Loan Default Prediction using IBM Watson AutoAI

Built an ML model using **IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI** to predict whether a loan applicant will default. AutoAI automates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. This project demonstrates how fast and efficient automated machine learning (AutoML) can be for solving real-world classification problems.

## üìå About the Project

This machine learning project leverages **IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI** to build a predictive model for loan default risk based on applicant information. With **minimal manual coding**, AutoAI handles:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Feature engineering
- Model training and selection
- Hyperparameter tuning

The project shows how AutoAI can accelerate ML development and provide strong baseline models for credit risk prediction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AutoAI Workflow

1. Upload the **Loan Default Dataset (train.csv)** to your IBM Watson Studio project.
2. Create a new **AutoAI experiment** and attach the dataset.
3. Select **target column**: `Loan_Status`
4. AutoAI performs:
   - Automated data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Feature transformation and encoding
   - Model generation using algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.
   - Hyperparameter optimization
   - Leaderboard evaluation for model comparison
5. The **best model** is chosen based on accuracy, F1-score, and other metrics.
6. Export or deploy the model for API-based predictions.

## üìà Results

- **Target Column**: Loan_Status  
- **Best Performing Model**: XGBoostClassifier (may vary based on dataset)  
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~82‚Äì85% (varies with data quality)  
- **Key Predictors Identified by AutoAI**:
  - Credit_History
  - ApplicantIncome
  - LoanAmount
  - Property_Area
  - Education

AutoAI also provides model explainability and a leaderboard of all trained models for comparison.
